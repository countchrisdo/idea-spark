# Idea Spark - Moodboards

![icon](https://i.imgur.com/bGkScfh.png)

Idea Spark is a brand new destination to view and share your ideas with the world! Create a board full of images to invoke your ideas and stir your creativity.

For the person who needs to curate their spring/summer vs fall/winter aesthetique. For the person upgrading their interior design to a Scandinavian post-modern architecture that doesn't scream "IKEA". But mainly for the person trying to draw inspiration from a bunch of images mish-mashed together in a semi-random, pleasing manner.
